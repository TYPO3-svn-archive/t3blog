Before you start implementing this blog please read the manual carefully.

*About getting support*
Yes, we would like to share your experience when you first implement this blog. 
Please refer to this website http://blog.snowflake.ch and look for the corresponding entries and comments. 
On this blog you have the possibility to send us your frustration, thank us, or just to read what is planned in the next release.
But this is not the right place to get support! Please send all your questions to the "English" TYPO3 mailing list. 
Many very experienced TYPO3 users will help you with installing, debugging or customizing. And in case of bugs please refer to the TYPO3 bugtracker which can be found on http://bugs.typo3.org/
Please do not send support requests to the authors of this extension. If you would like to have (commercial) support feel free to get in touch with snowflake productions gmbh, Dominic Brander, dbrander@snowflake.ch.
Thanks for sticking to the rules!

Have fun!
